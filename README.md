An interactive mobile app prototype showcasing a UX redesign of Immuny's allergy emergency app. Built by Kappa Theta Pi (USC) to minimize cognitive load and ensure users can navigate critical features in seconds during a high-stress allergic reaction.

## Features

- **Full iPhone Mockup:** Pixel-perfect iPhone frame with responsive scaling that adapts to any screen size, including scroll-wheel passthrough for the inner viewport
- **Emergency Response Flow:** One-tap access to detect a reaction, call emergency contacts, and locate the nearest ER, with critical actions reachable without thinking
- **Medical ID Screen:** Persistent display of allergens, current medications, and emergency contacts formatted for first responder access
- **Find ER Map View:** Nearby emergency room locator with map integration for rapid navigation during an emergency
- **Scanner Screen:** Allergen detection interface for scanning food products before consumption
- **Low-Cognitive-Load Design:** High contrast, large touch targets, teal/green brand palette (#00C896) on dark backgrounds, and smooth Framer Motion transitions to reduce friction
